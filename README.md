# deployment-heroku
Practicing Deployment of a Regression Model on Heroku, using Flask, and PyCaret.

# Learning Objectives:
  - Develop a machine learning pipeline and train models using PyCaret.
  - Build a simple web app using a Python framework called ‘Flask’.
  - Deploy a web app on ‘Heroku’ and see your model in action.
  
# Business Problem
An insurance company wants to improve its cash flow forecasting by better predicting patient charges using demographic and basic patient health risk metrics at the time of hospitalization.

# Objective
To build a web application where demographic and health information of a patient is entered in a web form to predict charges.

# Tasks
  - Train and validate models and develop a machine learning pipeline for deployment.
  - Build a basic HTML front-end with an input form for independent variables (age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region).
  - Build a back-end of the web application using a Flask Framework.
  - Deploy the web app on Heroku. Once deployed, it will become publicly available and can be accessed via Web URL.
